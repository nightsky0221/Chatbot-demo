Artificial   Intelligence   is changing  the   world.   
But   the   data   we   use   is   often   messy...   very messy!!!

In real-world   systems,   text   rarely   comes   cleanly.
Sometimes    there are   extra spaces,   sometimes there are   none.

People write like this?? Or like this!!! Or like this... 🤔🤔🤔

Emails,   chat messages,   social media posts — they ALL contain noise 😅  
Line breaks appear randomly,
and punctuation   is inconsistent   ,   very inconsistent   .

     Sometimes there are leading spaces.
Sometimes there are trailing spaces.      

And then there are blank lines...



Lots of them!!!

Emojis appear everywhere 😂 😂 😂
They might carry meaning ❤️, or just noise 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♀️.

AI models don’t always like:
- random spacing
- broken sentences
- weird punctuation!!!
- or emojis 🤖🔥

But humans write this way, and machines must learn to adapt.

Cleaning   text   is   not   optional.
It   is   a   requirement   for   NLP   pipelines.

Remember: Garbage   in   →   Garbage   out!!! 🚮🚮🚮
